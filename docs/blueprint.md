## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of intellect and focus.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F0F8FF), creating a clean and calm workspace.
- Accent color: Violet (#8A2BE2), providing subtle contrast to highlight key elements without distraction.
- Font pairing: 'Literata' (serif) for body text, creating a literary feel, and 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, for a techy but scientific balance.
- Use minimalist icons to represent different document types and actions, ensuring clarity and a distraction-free interface.
- Implement a responsive design with a clear three-column layout for project list/sources, chat/summaries, and source viewer. Ensure usability across desktop and mobile devices.
- Incorporate subtle animations, such as a progress bar during indexing and smooth transitions, to enhance user experience without being intrusive.
